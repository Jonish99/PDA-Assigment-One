# PDA-Assigment-One

## Assigment plan
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package. - Numpy.random
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

1. investigate numpy and create introduction to random
Offical Documentation https://numpy.org
    i. What it is.
    Numpy is an open source Python libary which is designed to enable numerical computing. 
    It was created in 2005 evolving from the Numeric and Numarray Python library. 
    random() is package within the numpy library

    Pandas, SciPy are Python libaries which use the Numpy library
    
    ii. Who uses it
    iii. Why it is ueful
    iv. History
    v. miminum demonstration
    vi. basic arrays and Ndarrays
    "NumPy is an open source project aiming to enable numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005, building on the early work of the Numeric and Numarray libraries." https://numpy.org/about/
    
    . NumPy is the primary array programming library for the
Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in felds as
diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials
science, engineering, fnance and economics. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2.pdf
    
 2. investigate “Simple random data” and “Permutations” and explain.
     demonstrate each.
     integers
     random
     choice
     bytes
     
     shuffle
     permuations
     
    
  
 3. determine five "Distribution functions" and demonstrate use of.
     Investigate these
     Normal
     Uniform
 
 4. what are pseudo random numbers?
